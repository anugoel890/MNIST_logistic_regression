#Image Classification: Logistic Regression on MNIST dataset using Pytorch


In this tutorial, we explain a simple real world example of logistic regression - image classification using Pytorch. For this we use MNIST Handwritten Digits Database for training, validating and testing our model.

MNIST dataset consists of images of 28 X 28 pixels that represents the handwritten numbers from 0 to 9. It also contains the output labels that the image actually represents.

Here, we use Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for minimizing the cross entropy loss function.
